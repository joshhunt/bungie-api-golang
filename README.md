# bungie-api-golang - Structs for the Bungie/Destiny API

This project implements Go structs for the [Bungie.net API](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api). The code is completely generated from Bungie's documentation - I previously the OpenAPI codegen tool, but found the generated code to be too messy so I opted for a custom generator so we could make the result as nice as possible.

Note: This was done in an afternoon, so it's quality maybe be questionable. It's probably missing API responses, and is definitely missing any of the API request helpers.

## Install

I'm new to Go. I have no idea.

Have a nice day.
